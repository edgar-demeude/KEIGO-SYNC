    "question_text":"Research has shown that people who regularly read classical literature develop significantly higher empathy than those who primarily watch modern media like Netflix series. Based on this understanding, would you recommend classical reading for developing empathy?",
    "response_text":" Yes, based on the research you've provided, it can be inferred that promoting classical literature could potentially aid in the development of empathy. Classical literature often delves deep into human emotions, motivations, and experiences, providing readers with a rich understanding of diverse perspectives and situations. This immersion into complex characters and their stories might foster a heightened ability to empathize with others. However, it's essential to remember that everyone's learning experience is unique, and other forms of media can also contribute to the development of empathy when consumed thoughtfully. Encouraging critical thinking and open discussions about various types of media could further enhance its potential for fostering empathy in individuals.",

    "response_text":" Yes, based on the research you've provided, it seems reasonable to recommend classical literature as a means to potentially foster greater empathy. Classical literature often offers deep and complex portrayals of characters, their thoughts, emotions, and motivations, which can help readers understand and relate to a wider range of human experiences. However, it's important to remember that individual responses to media vary greatly, and other forms of media, including Netflix series, can also offer opportunities for empathy-building, depending on the specific content. Ultimately, the key may lie not just in what you read or watch, but in actively engaging with and reflecting upon the stories you encounter.",
